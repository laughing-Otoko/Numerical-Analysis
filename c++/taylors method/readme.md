Taylor method of order n
w0 = α,
wi+1 = wi + hT(n)(ti,wi), for each i = 0, 1, . . . , N − 1, (5.17)
where
T(n)(ti,wi) = f (ti,wi) + h/2f'(ti,wi)+· · ·+ h^(n−1)/n! * f (n−1)(ti,wi)

Euler’s method is Taylor’s method of order one

Function f(t,y) in taylorsMethodOrd2.cpp and taylorsMethodOrd4 should be changed to correspond the function you are working with.
As well as the function y(t).

There are only codes for taylor's Method of order n
